                       Spirit of the License

This is an academic project, but I don't know where it will lead. I'm
licensing Laser this way in part to shield myself from liability (especially since
it rewrites code) and because it very well may have commercial applications
that I may wish to investigate.

                         Laser's License

Academic use only. No commercial or non-profit use. At least until
I know what I'm doing for sure. I couldn't find a legalese version of
an "academic use only" license, so I'll just write it again:

No non-academic use! No using Laser on code that will, at some point
in the near or distant future, produce monetary gain for you, your
relatives, your friends, your bosses, or anyone tangentially connected
to you. I don't care if you run it on legacy code that is defunct and
unused, but may have once derived you commercial gain. But don't run
it at your workplace. That's against the license.

Of course, that clearly means embedding Laser in an commercial product
is no good. And this license is definitely incompatible with any OSI-approved
license.

Oh, and this important bit from the GPL applies as well:

                            NO WARRANTY
