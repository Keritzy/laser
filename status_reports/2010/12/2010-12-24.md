Just noticed that the "Strict Unknowns" I described yesterday is already in-place
with only 1 specific constraint (super/sub-typing from a given class). I kind of
like my addition of "no idea but ensure consistency across calls" idea, and allowing
generic constraints is awesome.

Also, Scala uses `_`to mean "unknown", so I'm stealing it.
